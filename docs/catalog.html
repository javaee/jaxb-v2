          </div>
        </div>

        <p>It's very common for web resources to be related to
        other resources: documents rely on DTDs and schemas,
        schemas are derived from other schemas, stylesheets are
        often customizations of other stylesheets, documents refer
        to the schemas and stylesheets with which the expect to be
        processed, etc. These relationships are expressed using
        URIs, most often URLs.</p>

        <p>Relying on URLs to directly identify resources to be
        retrieved often causes problems for end users:</p>

        <div class="orderedlist">
          <ol type="1">
            <li>
              <p>If they're absolute URLs, they only work when you
              can reach them<sup>[<a name="d0e109" href=
              "#ftn.d0e109">1</a>]</sup>. Relying on remote
              resources makes XML processing susceptible to both
              planned and unplanned network downtime.</p>

              <p>The URL
              &#8220;http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/xml/4.1.2/docbookx.dtd&#8221;
              isn't very useful if I'm on an airplane at 35,000
              feet.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>If they're relative URLs, they're only useful in
              the context where the were initially created.</p>

              <p>The URL &#8220;../../xml/dtd/docbookx.xml&#8221;
              isn't useful <span class=
              "emphasis"><i>anywhere</i></span> on my system.
              Neither, for that matter, is
              &#8220;/export/home/fred/docbook412/docbookx.xml&#8221;.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        <p>One way to avoid these problems is to use an entity
        resolver (a standard part of SAX) or a URI Resolver (a
        standard part of JAXP). A resolver can examine the URIs of
        the resources being requested and determine how best to
        satisfy those requests.</p>

        <p>The best way to make this function in an interoperable
        way is to define a standard format for mapping system
        identifiers and URIs. The <a href=
        "http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/entity/" target=
        "_top">OASIS Entity Resolution Technical Committee</a> is
        defining an XML representation for just such a mapping.
        These &#8220;catalog files&#8221; can be used to map public
        and system identifiers and other URIs to local files (or
        just other URIs).</p>

          <p>The Resolver classes that are described in this
          article greatly simplify the task of using Catalog files
          to perform entity resolution. Many users will want to
          simply use these classes directly &#8220;out of the
          box&#8221; with their applications (such as Xalan and
          Saxon), but developers may also be interested in the <a

          Documentation</a>.</p>

          </div>
        </div>

        <p>The problems associated with system identifiers (and
        URIs in general) arise in several ways:</p>

        <div class="orderedlist">
          <ol type="1">
            <li>
              <p>I have an XML document that I want to publish on
              the web or include in the distribution of some piece
              of software. On my system, I keep the doctype of the
              document in some local directory, so my doctype
              declaration reads:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
&lt;!DOCTYPE article PUBLIC "-//OASIS//DTD DocBook XML V4.1.2//EN"
                  "file:///n:/share/doctypes/docbook/xml/docbookx.dtd"&gt;
</pre>

              <p>As soon as I distribute this document, I
              immediately begin getting error reports from
              customers who can't read the document because they
              don't have DocBook installed at the location
              identified by the URI in my document.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Or I remember to change the URI before I publish
              the document:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
&lt;!DOCTYPE article PUBLIC "-//OASIS//DTD DocBook XML V4.1.2//EN"
                  "http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/xml/4.1.2/docbookx.dtd"&gt;
</pre>

              <p>And the next time I try to edit the document,
              <span class="emphasis"><i>I get errors</i></span>
              because I happen to be working on my laptop on a
              plane somewhere and can't get to the net.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Just as often, I get tripped up this way: I'm
              working collaboratively with a colleague. She's
              created initial drafts of some documents that I'm
              supposed to review and edit. So I grab them and find
              that I can't open or publish them because I don't
              have the same network connections she has or I don't
              have my applications installed in the same place. And
              if I change the system identifiers so they work on my
              system, she has the same problems when I send them
              back to her.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>These problems aren't limited to editing
              applications. If I write a special stylesheet for
              formatting our collaborative document, it will
              include some reference to the &#8220;main&#8221;
              stylesheet:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
&lt;xsl:import href="/path/to/real/stylesheet.xsl"/&gt;
</pre>

              <p>But this won't work on my colleague's machine
              because she has the main stylesheet installed
              somewhere else.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        <p>Public identifiers offer an effective solution to this
        problem, at least for documents. They provide global,
        unique names for entities independent of their storage
        location. Unfortunately, public identifiers aren't used
        very often because many users find that they cannot rely on
        applications resolving them in an interoperable manner.</p>

        <p>For XSLT, XML Schemas, and other applications that rely
        on URIs without providing a mechanism for associating
        public identifiers with them, the situation is a little
        more irksome, but it can still be addressed using a URI
        Resolver.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <div class="titlepage">
          <div>
            <h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name=
            "d0e212"></a>Naming Resources</h2>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>In some contexts, it's more useful to refer to a
        resource by name than by address. If I want the version 3.1
        of the DocBook DTD, or the 1911 edition of Webster's
        dictionary, or <i>The Declaration of Independence</i>,
        that's what I want, irrespective of its location on the net
        (or even if it's available on the net). While it is
        possible to view a URL as an address, I don't think that's
        the natural interpretation.</p>

        <p>There are currently two ways that I might reasonably
        assign an address-independent name to an object: public
        identifiers or <a href=
        "http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2141.txt" target="_top">Uniform
        Resource Names</a> (URNs)<sup>[<a name="d0e225" href=
        "#ftn.d0e225">2</a>]</sup>.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <div class="titlepage">
            <div>
              <h3 class="title"><a name="d0e229"></a>Public
              Identifiers</h3>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>Public identifiers are part of <a href=
          "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml" target="_top">XML 1.0</a>.
          They can occur in any form of external entity
          declaration. They allow you to give a globally unique
          name to any entity. For example, the XML version of
          DocBook V4.1.2 is identified with the following public
          identifier:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
-//OASIS//DTD DocBook XML V4.1.2//EN
</pre>

          <p>You'll see this identifier in the two doctype
          declarations I used earlier. This identifier gives no
          indication of where the resource (the DTD) may be found,
          but it does uniquely name the resource. That public
          identifier, now and forever refers to the XML version of
          DocBook V4.1.2.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <div class="titlepage">
            <div>
              <h3 class="title"><a name="d0e241"></a>Uniform
              Resource Names</h3>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>URNs are a form of URI. Like public identifiers, they
          give a location-neutral, globally unique name to an
          entity. For example, OASIS might choose to identify the
          XML version of DocBook V4.1.2 with the following URN:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
urn:oasis:names:specification:docbook:dtd:xml:4.1.2
</pre>

          <p>Like a public identifier, a URN can now and forever
          refer to a specific entity in a location-independent
          manner.</p>

          <div class="section">
            <div class="titlepage">
              <div>
                <h4 class="title"><a name="d0e250"></a>The publicid
                URN Namespace</h4>
              </div>
            </div>

            <p>Public identifiers don't fit very well into the web
            architecture (they are not, for example, always valid
            URIs). This problem can be addressed by the
            <tt>publicid</tt> URN namespace defined by <a href=
            "http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3151.txt" target="_top">RFC
            3151</a>.</p>

            <p>This namespace allows public identifiers to be
            easily represented as URNs. The OASIS XML Catalog
            specification accords special status to URNs of this
            form so that catalog resolution occurs in the expected
            way.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <div class="titlepage">
          <div>
            <h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name=
            "d0e263"></a>Resolving Names</h2>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>Having extolled the virtues of location-independent
        names, it must be said that a name isn't very useful if you
        can't find the thing it refers to. In order to do that, you
        must have a name resolution mechanism that allows you to
        determine what resource is referred to by a given name.</p>

        <p>One important feature of this mechanism is that it can
        allow resources to be distributed, so you don't have to go
        to <a href=
        "http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/xml/4.1.2/docbookx.dtd"
        target=
        "_top">http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/xml/4.1.2/docbookx.dtd</a>
        to get the XML version of DocBook V4.1.2, if you have a
        local copy.</p>

        <p>There are a few possible resolution mechanisms:</p>

        <div class="itemizedlist">
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>
              <p>The application just &#8220;knows&#8221;. Sure, it
              sounds a little silly, but this is currently the
              mechanism being used for namespaces. Applications
              know what the semantics of namespaced elements are
              because they recognize the namespace URI.</p>

              <p>OASIS Catalog files provide a mechanism for
              mapping public and system identifiers, allowing
              resolution to both local and distributed resources.
              This is the resolution scheme we're going to consider
              for the balance of this column.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Many other mechanisms are possible. There are
              already a few for URNs, including at least one built
              on top of DNS, but they aren't widely deployed.</p>

          </div>
        </div>

        <p>Catalog files are straightforward text files that
        describe a mapping from names to addresses. Here's a simple
        one:</p>

        <div class="example">
          <p><b>Example 1. An Example Catalog File</b></p>
<pre class="programlisting">
&lt;catalog xmlns="urn:oasis:names:tc:entity:xmlns:xml:catalog"&gt;

&lt;public publicId="-//OASIS//DTD XML DocBook V4.1.2//EN"
        uri="docbook/xml/docbookx.dtd"/&gt;

&lt;system systemId="urn:x-oasis:docbook-xml-v4.1.2"
        uri="docbook/xml/docbookx.dtd"/&gt;

&lt;delegatePublic publicIdStartString="-//Example//"
          catalog="http://www.example.com/catalog"/&gt;
&lt;/catalog&gt;
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>This file maps both the public identifier and the URN I
        mentioned earlier to a local copy of DocBook on my system.
        If the doctype declaration uses the public identifier for
        DocBook, <span class="emphasis"><i>I'll get
        DocBook</i></span> regardless of the (possibly bogus)
        system identifier! Likewise, my local copy of DocBook will
        be used if the system identifier contains the DocBook
        URN.</p>

        <p>The delegate entry instructs the resolver to use the
        catalog
        &#8220;<tt>http://www.example.com/catalog</tt>&#8221; for
        any public identifier that begins with
        &#8220;-//Example//&#8221;. The advantage of delegate in
        this case is that I don't have to parse that catalog file
        unless I encounter a public identifier that I reasonably
        expect to find there.</p>
      </div>

          <p>OASIS XML Catalogs are being defined by the <a href=
          "http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/entity/" target=
          "_top">Entity Resolution Technical Committee</a>. This
          article describes the 01 Aug 2001 draft. Note that this
          draft is labelled to reflect that it is &#8220;not an
          official committee work product and may not reflect the
          consensus opinion of the committee.&#8221;</p>

          <p>The document element for OASIS XML Catalogs is <tt
          class="sgmltag-element">catalog</tt>. The official
          namespace name for OASIS XML Catalogs is
          &#8220;<tt>urn:oasis:names:tc:entity:xmlns:xml:catalog</tt>&#8221;.</p>

          <p>There are eight elements that can occur in an XML
          Catalog: <tt class="sgmltag-element">group</tt>, <tt
          class="sgmltag-element">public</tt>, <tt class=
          "sgmltag-element">system</tt>, <tt class=
          "sgmltag-element">uri</tt>, <tt class=
          "sgmltag-element">delegatePublic</tt>, <tt class=
          "sgmltag-element">delegateSystem</tt>, <tt class=
          "sgmltag-element">delegateURI</tt>, and <tt class=
          "sgmltag-element">nextCatalog</tt>:</p>

          <div class="variablelist">
            <dl>
              <dt><a name="catalog"></a><span class=
              "term"><tt>&lt;catalog
              <i><tt>prefer="public|system"</tt></i>
              <i><tt>xml:base="uri-reference"</tt></i>&gt;</tt></span></dt>

              <dd>
                <p>The <tt class="sgmltag-element">catalog</tt>
                element is the root of an XML Catalog.</p>

                <p>The <tt class="sgmltag-attribute">prefer</tt>
                setting determines whether or not public
                identifiers specified in the catalog are to be used
                in favor of system identifiers supplied in the
                document. Suppose you have an entity in your
                document for which both a public identifier and a
                system identifier has been specified, and the
                catalog only contains a mapping for the public
                identifier (e.g., a matching <tt class=
                "sgmltag-element">public</tt> catalog entry). If
                the current value of <tt class=
                "sgmltag-attribute">prefer</tt> is
                &#8220;public&#8221;, the URI supplied in the
                matching <tt class="sgmltag-element">public</tt>
                catalog entry will be used. If it is
                &#8220;system&#8221;, the system identifier in the
                document will be used. (If the catalog contained a
                matching <tt class="sgmltag-element">system</tt>
                catalog entry giving a mapping for the system
                identifier, that mapping would have been used, the
                public identifier would never have been considered,
                and the setting of override would have been
                irrelevant.)</p>

                <p>Generally, the purpose of catalogs is to
                override the system identifiers in XML documents,
                so <tt class="sgmltag-attribute">prefer</tt> should
                usually be &#8220;public&#8221; in your
                catalogs.</p>

                <p>The <tt class="sgmltag-attribute">xml:base</tt>
                URI is used to resolve relative URIs in the catalog
                as described in the <a href=
                "http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlbase" target="_top">XML

            Applications</h2>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>If you work with Java applications using a parser that
        supports the SAX1 <tt>Parser</tt> interface or the SAX2
        <tt>XMLReader</tt> interface, adding Catalog support to
        your applications is a snap. The SAX interfaces include an
        <tt>entityResolver</tt> hook designed to provide an
        application with an opportunity to do this sort of
        indirection. The Resolver classes implements the full OASIS
        Catalog semantics and provide an appropriate class that
        implements the SAX <tt>entityResolver</tt> interface.</p>

        <p>All you have to do is setup a
        <tt>com.sun.resolver.tools.CatalogResolver</tt> on your
        parser's <tt>entityResolver</tt> hook. The code listing in
        <a href="#ex1" title=
        "Example 3. Adding a CatalogResolver to Your Parser">Example
        3</a> demonstrates how straightforward this is:</p>

        <div class="example">
          <p><a name="ex1"></a><b>Example 3. Adding a
          CatalogResolver to Your Parser</b></p>

import com.sun.resolver.tools.CatalogResolver;
...
    CatalogResolver cr = new CatalogResolver();
...
    yourParser.setEntityResolver(cr)
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>The system catalogs are loaded from the
        <tt>CatalogManager.properties</tt> file on your
        <tt>CLASSPATH</tt>. (For all the gory details about these
        classes, consult <a href="apidocs/index.html" target=
        "_top">the API documentation</a>.) You can explicitly parse
        your own catalogs (perhaps taken from command line
        arguments or a Preferences dialog) instead of or in
        addition to the system catalogs.</p>
      </div>

          </div>
        </div>

        <p>The Resolver distribution includes a couple of test
        programs, <b>resolver</b> and <b>xparse</b>, that you can
        use to see how this all works.</p>

        <div class="section">

            </div>
          </div>

          <p>The <b>resolver</b> application simply performs a
          catalog lookup and returns the result. Given the
          following catalog:</p>

          <div class="example">
            <p><a name="ex.catalog.xml"></a><b>Example 4. An
            Example XML Catalog File</b></p>
<pre class="programlisting">
&lt;catalog xmlns="urn:oasis:names:tc:entity:xmlns:xml:catalog"&gt;

&lt;public publicId="-//Example//DTD Example V1.0//EN"
        uri="example.dtd"/&gt;

&lt;/catalog&gt;
</pre>
          </div>

          <p>A demonstration of public identifier resolution can be
          achieved like this:</p>

            </div>
          </div>

          <p>The <b>xparse</b> command simply sets up a catalog
          resolver and then parses a document. Any external
          entities encountered during the parse are resolved
          appropriately using the catalogs provided.</p>

          <p>In order to use the program, you must have the
          <tt>resolver.jar</tt> file on your <tt>CLASSPATH</tt> and
          you must be using <a href="http://java.sun.com/xml/"
          target="_top">JAXP</a>. In the examples that follow, I've
          already got these files on my <tt>CLASSPATH</tt>.</p>

          <p>The file we'll be parsing is shown in <a href=
          "#ex.example.xml" title=
          "Example 6. An xparse Example File">Example 6</a>.</p>

          <div class="example">
            <p><a name="ex.example.xml"></a><b>Example 6. An xparse

&lt;!DOCTYPE example PUBLIC "-//Example//DTD Example V1.0//EN"
                  "file:///dev/this/does/not/exist/example.dtd"&gt;
&lt;example&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just a trivial example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/example&gt;
</pre>
          </div>

          <p>First let's look at what happens if you try to parse
          this document without any catalogs. For this example, I
          deleted the <tt>catalogs</tt> entry on my
          <tt>CatalogManager.properties</tt> file. As expected, the
          parse fails:</p>

          <div class="example">
            <p><a name="ex.nocat.sh"></a><b>Example 7. Parsing
            Without a Catalog</b></p>
<pre class="screen">
$ java com.sun.resolver.apps.xparse -d 2 example.xml

Fatal error:example.xml:2:External entity not found:
   "file:///dev/this/does/not/exist/example.dtd".
Parse failed with 1 error and no warnings.
</pre>
          </div>

          <p>With an appropriate catalog file, we can map the
          public identifier to a local copy of the DTD. We could
          have mapped the system identifier instead (or as well),
          but the public identifier is probably more stable.</p>

          <p>Using a command-line option to specify the catalog, I
          can now successfully parse the document:</p>

          <div class="example">
            <p><a name="ex.withcat.sh"></a><b>Example 8. Parsing
            With a Catalog</b></p>
<pre class="screen">
$ java com.sun.resolver.apps.xparse -d 2 -c catalog.xml example.xml

Resolved public: -//Example//DTD Example V1.0//EN
    file:/share/documents/articles/sun/2001/01-resolver/example/example.dtd
Parse succeeded (0.32) with no errors and no warnings.
</pre>
          </div>

          <p>The additional messages in each of these examples
          arise as a consequence of the debugging option, <i><tt>-d
          2</tt></i>. In practice, you can make resolution
          silent.</p>

        <p>We hope that these classes become a standard part of
        your toolkit. Incorporating this code allows you to utilize
        public identifiers in XML documents with the confidence
        that you will be able to move those documents from one

          It is technically possible to use a proxy to
          transparently cache remote resources, thus making the
          cached resources available even when the real hosts are
          unreachable. In practice, this requires more technical
          skill (and system administration access) than many users
          have available. And I don't know of any such proxies that
          can be configured to provide preferential caching to the
          specific resources that are needed. Without such
          preferential treatment, its difficult to be sure that the
          resources you need are actually in the cache.</p>

          URIs that rely on the domain name system to identify
          objects (in other words, all URLs) are addresses, not
          names, even though the domain name provides a level of
          indirection and the illusion of a stable name.</p>
