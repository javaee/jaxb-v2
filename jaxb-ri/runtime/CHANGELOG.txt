Changes since JAXB 1.0 FCS (JWSDP 1.1 FCS)
------------------------------------------

o Kohsuke 04.23.2003

  runtime is made a bit more robust to errors; when the unmarshaller sees
  an unexpected element, it tries to recover from it by ignoring it.
  (the ValidationEventHandler needs to let it continue, of course)
  
  the error handling inside the unmarshaller is refactored.

o Kohsuke 03.27.2003

  added NIO based smarter character escaping. The code can still work
  with JDK1.3 or earlier, but you need JDK1.4 to enjoy this behavior.

o Kohsuke 03.13.2003

  made the unmarshaller more robust when dealing with incorrectly created
  non namespace aware DOM nodes.

o Kohsuke 03.05.2003

   fixed a problem where the indentation is not done even if the formatted
   output option is turned on.
