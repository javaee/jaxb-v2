                    <para>Can I run my existing JAXB 1.0.x applications on the
                    JAXB 2.0 runtime?</para>

                <answer>
                    <para>This is no longer supported. However, you should be able to deploy 
                    <filename>http://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=com/sun/xml/bind/jaxb1-impl/2.2.5-1/jaxb1-impl-2.2.5-1.jar</filename> with your

                    <para>What if I want to port my JAXB 1.0.x application to JAXB 2.0?</para>
                </question>

                <answer>
                    <para>You need to recompile your schema with the newer
                    JAXB 2.0 xjc and modify your application code to work with
                    the new bindings.</para>

            <qandaentry>
                <question>
                    <para>Are the JAXB runtime API's thread safe?</para>
                </question>

                <answer>
                    <para>The JAXB Specification currently does not address
                    the thread safety of any of the runtime classes. In the
                    case of the Oracle JAXB RI, the
                    <literal>JAXBContext</literal> class <emphasis
                    role="bold">is</emphasis> thread safe, but the
                    <literal>Marshaller</literal>,
                    <literal>Unmarshaller</literal>, and
                    <literal>Validator</literal> classes <emphasis
                    role="bold">are not</emphasis> thread safe.</para>

                    <para>For example, suppose you have a multi-thread server
                    application that processes incoming XML documents by JAXB.
                    In this case, for the best performance you should have
                    just one instance of <literal>JAXBContext</literal> in
                    your whole application like this:</para>

                    <informalexample>
                        <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[class MyServlet extends HttpServlet {
    static final JAXBContext context = initContext();

    private static JAXBContext initContext() {
        return JAXBContext.newInstance("....", MyServlet.class.getClassLoader());
    }
}]]></programlisting>
                    </informalexample>

                    <para>And each time you need to unmarshal/marshal/validate
                    a document. Just create a new
                    <literal>Unmarshaller</literal>/<literal>Marshaller</literal>/<literal>Validator</literal>
                    from this context, like this:</para>

                    <informalexample>
                        <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[public void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp) {
    Unmarshaller u = context.createUnmarshaller();
    u.unmarshal(...);
}]]></programlisting>
                    </informalexample>

                    <para>This is the simplest safe way to use the JAXB RI
                    from multi-threaded applications.</para>

                    <para>If you really care about the performance, and/or
                    your application is going to read a lot of small
                    documents, then creating <literal>Unmarshaller</literal>
                    could be relatively an expensive operation. In that case,
                    consider pooling <literal>Unmarshaller</literal> objects.
                    Different threads may reuse one
                    <literal>Unmarshaller</literal> instance, as long as you
                    don't use one instance from two threads at the same
                    time.</para>
                </answer>
            </qandaentry>

            <qandaentry>
                <question>
                    <para>Why can't I cast the unmarshalled object into the
                    generated type.</para>
                </question>

                <answer>
                    <para>When you invoke
                    <literal>JAXBContext.newInstance("aaa.bbb.ccc")</literal>,
                    it tries to load classes and resources using the same
                    classloader used to load the
                    <literal>JAXBContext</literal> class itself. This
                    classloader may be different from the classloader which
                    was used to load your application (see the picture <xref
                    linkend="faq-figure-1" xrefstyle="select:title" />). In
                    this case, you'll see the above error. This problem is
                    often seen with application servers, J2EE containers, Ant,
                    JUnit, and other applications that use sophisticated class
                    loading mechanisms.</para>

                    <figure xml:id="faq-figure-1">
                        <title>Parent/Child classloader</title>

                        <mediaobject>
                            <imageobject>
                                <imagedata contentdepth="100%"
                                           fileref="figures/classLoaderFAQ.gif"
                                           scalefit="1" width="100%"></imagedata>
                            </imageobject>
                        </mediaobject>
                    </figure>

                    <para>With some applications, things get even more
                    complicated when the JAXB-generated code can be loaded by
                    either classloader. In this case,
                    <literal>JAXBContext.newInstance("aaa.bbb.ccc")</literal>
                    will work but the JVM ends up loading two copies of the
                    generated classes for each class loader. As a result,
                    unmarshalling works but an attempt to cast the returned
                    object into the expected type will fail, even though its
                    <literal>getClass().getName()</literal> returns the
                    expected name.</para>

                    <para>The solution for both situations is to pass your
                    curent class loader like this:</para>

                    <informalexample>
                        <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[JAXBContext.newInstance("aaa.bbb.ccc", this.getClass().getClassLoader());]]></programlisting>
                    </informalexample>

                    <para>In general, if you are writing code that uses JAXB,
                    it is always better to explicitly pass in a class loader,
                    so that your code will work no matter where it is
                    deployed.</para>
                </answer>

                    <para>How can I cause the <literal>Marshaller</literal> to
                    generate <literal>CDATA</literal> blocks?</para>
                </question>

                <answer>
                    <para>This functionality is not available from JAXB
                    directly, but you can configure an Apache Xerces-J
                    <literal>XMLSerializer</literal> to produce
                    <literal>CDATA</literal> blocks. Please review the <link

                    <para>Can I access &lt;xs:any/&gt; as a DOM node?</para>
                </question>

                <answer>
                    <para>In JAXB 2.0, &lt;xs:any/&gt; is handled correctly
                    without any customization.</para>
