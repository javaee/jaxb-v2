    <title>Using JAXB from Maven</title>

    <example>
        <title>If you are using Maven 2 as your build system, you can declare
        the following dependencies in your POM for using the JAXB RI. Replace
        the version with the version of your choice.</title>

        <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<dependency>
  <groupId>com.sun.xml.bind</groupId>
  <artifactId>jaxb-impl</artifactId>
  <version>2.1.8</version>
</dependency>]]></programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>This artifact is available in <link
    xlink:href="https://maven-repository.dev.java.net/">the java.net Maven
    repository</link>, so you also need the following <literal>&lt;repository&gt;</literal>
    declaration in your POM:</para>

    <informalexample>
        <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<repository>
  <id>java.net</id>
  <url>http://download.java.net/maven/1</url>
  <layout>legacy</layout>
</repository>]]></programlisting>
    </informalexample>

    <para>For a list of available artifacts and versions, see <link
    xlink:href="http://download.java.net/maven/1/com.sun.xml.bind/jars/">this</link>.
    In addition to the runtime jar, XJC is available under the artifact Id
    "<literal>jaxb-xjc</literal>".</para>

    <para>You can also invoke XJC through a Maven plugin by using <link
    xlink:href="https://maven-jaxb2-plugin.dev.java.net/">the Maven2 JAXB 2.x
    plugin</link>.</para>
