XJC unit tests are a series of developer tests for XJC.


Test data
=========
Test schemas, instance documents, and other files necessary for test are stored in jaxb-ri/test/schemas directory.

Usually, each test gets its own directory. Each such directory contains "Testspec.meta" file, which describes how that test should be run. A test case consists of a schema file, zero or more test instances, and zero or more test script written in ECMAScript.

A test is executed by first compiling the schema, then running all (script,instance) pair.

Multiple test cases can be stored in the suite format (.ssuite) for the ease of maintainance.


Running All Tests
=================
Build the "run-xjc-test" target. This will run all the tests and dump the results to stdout.


Running Selectively
===================
Build the "test-preparation" target to prepare everything for a test. Then, run "TestCaseRunner" as follows. This will run a single test case:

$ java TestCaseRunner ../../test/schemas/Unmarshaller/list1/testspec.meta


The following command will run all the tests under the specified directory (the "-r" option):

$ java TestCaseRunner ../../test/schemas/Unmarshaller/ -r


Debugging
=========
When you are tracking down a problem, oftentimes you want to enable some of the debug options of XJC (such as the "-trace-unmarshaller" option.) To do this, use the "-xjc" option.

$ java TestCaseRunner ../../test/schemas/Unmarshaller/list1 -xjc -trace-unmarshaller

Those additional options will be passed to XJC.
