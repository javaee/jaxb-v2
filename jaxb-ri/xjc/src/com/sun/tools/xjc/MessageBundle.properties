Driver.Private.Usage = \
Additional private testing options:\n\
\ \ -debug             :  run in debug mode (includes -verbose)\n\
\ \ -mode <mode>       :  run XJC in other running mode\n\
\ \ -private           :  display this help message\n\
Mode:\n\
\ \ code         :  generate Java source code (default)\n\
\ \ dryrun       :  compile the schema in memory, but don't generate the Java source\n\
\ \ zip          :  generate Java source code into a zip file specified by the -d option\n\
\ \ sig          :  dump the signatures of the generated code\n\
\ \ forest       :  dump transformed DOM forest\n\

Driver.Public.Usage = \
Usage: xjc [-options ...] <schema file/URL/dir/jar> ... [-b <bindinfo>] ...\n\
If dir is specified, all schema files in it will be compiled.\n\
If jar is specified, /META-INF/sun-jaxb.episode binding file will be compiled.\n\
Options:\n\
\ \ -nv                :  do not perform strict validation of the input schema(s)\n\
\ \ -extension         :  allow vendor extensions - do not strictly follow the\n\
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ Compatibility Rules and App E.2 from the JAXB Spec\n\
\ \ -b <file/dir>      :  specify external bindings files (each <file> must have its own -b)\n\
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ If a directory is given, **/*.xjb is searched\n\
\ \ -d <dir>           :  generated files will go into this directory\n\
\ \ -p <pkg>           :  specifies the target package\n\
\ \ -httpproxy <proxy> :  set HTTP/HTTPS proxy. Format is [user[:password]@]proxyHost:proxyPort\n\
\ \ -httpproxyfile <f> :  Works like -httpproxy but takes the argument in a file to protect password \n\
\ \ -classpath <arg>   :  specify where to find user class files\n\
\ \ -catalog <file>    :  specify catalog files to resolve external entity references\n\
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ support TR9401, XCatalog, and OASIS XML Catalog format.\n\
\ \ -readOnly          :  generated files will be in read-only mode\n\
\ \ -npa               :  suppress generation of package level annotations (**/package-info.java)\n\
\ \ -no-header         :  suppress generation of a file header with timestamp\n\
\ \ -target (2.0|2.1)  :  behave like XJC 2.0 or 2.1 and generate code that doesn't use any 2.2 features.\n\
\ \ -encoding <encoding> :  specify character encoding for generated source files\n\
\ \ -enableIntrospection :  enable correct generation of Boolean getters/setters to enable Bean Introspection apis \n\
\ \ -disableXmlSecurity  :  disables XML security features when parsing XML documents \n\
\ \ -contentForWildcard  :  generates content property for types with multiple xs:any derived elements \n\
\ \ -xmlschema         :  treat input as W3C XML Schema (default)\n\
\ \ -relaxng           :  treat input as RELAX NG (experimental,unsupported)\n\

\ \ -wsdl              :  treat input as WSDL and compile schemas inside it (experimental,unsupported)\n\
\ \ -verbose           :  be extra verbose\n\
