Options:\n\
\ \ -debug             :  run in debug mode (includes -verbose)\n\
\ \ -nv                :  do not perform strict validation of the input schema(s)\n\

\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ Compatibility Rules and App E.2 from the JAXB Spec\n\
\ \ -mode <mode>       :  run XJC in other running mode\n\

\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ If a directory is given, **/*.xjb is searched\n\
\ \ -d <dir>           :  generated files will go into this directory\n\
\ \ -httpproxy <proxy> :  set HTTP/HTTPS proxy. Format is [user[:password]@]proxyHost:proxyPort\n\
